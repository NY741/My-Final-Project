      "In the wake of a Manhattan grand jury’s historic decision to indict Donald Trump, the former president and some other prominent Republicans, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have invoked liberal billionaire George Soros in their attacks on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Trump claimed in a statement that Bragg was “hand-picked and funded by George Soros.”Soros, a longtime supporter of Democratic campaigns, various liberal causes and prosecutors who favor criminal justice reform, has been a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories painting the Jewish philanthropist as a puppetmaster behind various US and international events. Soros did not make any direct contributions to Bragg’s 2021 election campaign, and a Soros spokesperson, Michael Vachon, told CNN last week that the two men have never once communicated in any way.Rather, Soros’s connection to Bragg is indirect: he has been a major donor to a liberal political action committee that supported Bragg’s candidacy. A spokesperson for the PAC denounced the Soros-related attacks on Bragg in an interview with CNN last week, calling them “antisemitic,” “anti-Black” and an overstatement of both Soros’s role in the PAC’s decision-making and the PAC’s role in Bragg’s election victory.",

The situation eased on April 6 and Marshall was able to get into the Top 10 with 19.7 million streams gained on that day. So after days of lull, there is finally some movement in the Top 10.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday ordered the immediate market withdrawal of a drug intended to prevent premature births, which has remained available for years despite data showing it doesn’t help pregnant women. The decision follows repeated efforts by Swiss drugmaker Covis Pharma to keep Makena on the U.S. market while it conducted additional studies. The medication was the only drug approved in the U.S. to help reduce the risk of early births in women with a history of preterm deliveries. In recent months, Covis finally bowed to FDA pressure, proposing a “winding down” period of several months so that women taking the drug could complete their treatment. The FDA rejected that and said Thursday that the action against Makena and several generic versions should take effect immediately. “Makena and its generics are no longer approved and cannot lawfully be distributed in interstate commerce,” the agency said in a statement.",

      "A head teachers' union in England has voted overwhelmingly to reject the government's pay offer for teachers. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), mainly representing primary heads, is considering balloting members again over strike action. It is the third union to reject the offer - including the National Education Union (NEU), which is planning further strikes. The government says further strike action is 'extremely disappointing'. Most state school teachers in England had a 5% pay rise in 2022. They were offered a 4.3% rise next year, as well as a £1,000 one-off payment this year. Starting salaries would also rise to £30,000 from September.    The government said it believed schools could afford to fund most of the pay rise from their budgets, and that extra money would have been provided to make up the rest. But unions have been campaigning for a fully funded pay rise, arguing that taking the money from schools' budgets could mean they have to make cuts elsewhere.",

If Rip van Winkle had dozed off when the Good Friday agreement was signed in 1998 and woke up now, 25 years later, he may not have noticed much difference in the presence of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. A quarter of a century after the end of the Troubles, republican and loyalist paramilitary groups still recruit, still march, still intimidate and, on occasion, still kill. The conflict is over. The Provisional IRA is fading into history and loyalist groups do not menace Catholics. But a less deadly form of paramilitarism remains woven into society, reflecting and aggravating political dysfunction. Dissidents republicans are expected to parade through Derry on 10 April, raising fears of a repeat of previous Easter week rallies that led to clashes between youths and police. Last month, MI5 restored the terrorism threat level from substantial to severe – meaning an attack is highly likely – just a year after it was lowered from severe for the first time in 12 years.

BYD, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, announced Monday a new technological system for stabilizing car rides through rugged terrain, sharp turns and even shallow water. The shock absorption tech is set to be a feature of the company’s recently launched premium brand Yangwang. “Traditionally, luxury cars were determined by brand and history. For luxury new energy vehicles, it’s a matter of what tech and products,” BYD founder Wang Chuanfu said in Mandarin at a launch event Monday, according to a CNBC translation. He claimed the tech represented a “breakthrough” that “leads and surpasses foreign technological level.” The update comes ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show, set to kick off next week, where many Chinese car companies are set to make product and model announcements. Part of the tech system uses the same “lidar” sensors used in assisted driving, according to BYD. Lidar, short for “light detection and ranging,” uses lasers to create detailed maps of the surrounding area. The automaker said in a release its new “DiSus” system “provides a foundation for the future development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).”",

Attorney General Karl Racine sued the Commanders in November, alleging the team cheated residents out of their security deposits collected from season ticket holders and used the money for its own purposes. The lawsuit also claimed the team “intentionally complicated the return process by imposing extra, burdensome conditions that were not previously adequately disclosed.” Racine alleged the Commanders sold premium seating tickets to D.C. fans since 1996, which sometimes required a security deposit. While the team promised tickets holders they would get their deposits back within 30 days of the contracts’ expiration, Racine alleged the team pocketed the money, sometimes for over a decade, and spent it. A Commanders spokesperson said in a statement the team hasn’t collected security deposits in more than a decade and has been “actively working to return any remaining deposits since 2014.”",

      "Antarctica's melting ice sheet could retreat much faster than previously thought, new research suggests. The evidence comes from markings on the seafloor off Norway that record the pull-back of a melting European ice sheet thousands of years ago. Today, the fastest withdrawing glaciers in Antarctica are seen to retreat by up to 30m a day. But if they sped up, the extra melt water would have big implications for sea-level rises around the globe. Ice losses from Antarctica caused by climate change have already pushed up the surface of the world's oceans by nearly 1cm since the 1990s. The researchers found that with the Norwegian sheet, the maximum retreat was more than 600m a day. This is something we could see if we continue with the upper estimates for temperature rise, explained Dr Christine Batchelor from Newcastle University, UK. Although, worryingly, when we did the equations to think about what would be needed to instigate such retreat in Antarctica, we actually found there are places where you could get similar pulses of withdrawal even under the basal melt rates we know are happening at the moment, she told BBC News.",

      "Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth’s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet. Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years! Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth’s inner structure. They’ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists —  including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago — have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth’s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.",

The International Court of Justice will now prepare an advisory opinion that could be cited in climate court cases. The motion came from Vanuatu, a low-lying Pacific island nation facing peril from rising sea levels. Vanuatu's Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau called it a win for climate justice of epic proportions. The motion, sponsored by more than 130 countries, was greeted with cheers. The idea for the legal opinion was originally proposed by law students in Fiji four years ago. It was then taken up by Vanuatu, a country with bitter experience of the impacts of rising temperatures. Earlier this year it , at an estimated cost in damages of roughly half the country's annual GDP.",

      "In spring 1949, three prospectors armed with Geiger counters set out to hunt for treasure in the arid mountains of southern Nevada and southeastern California. In the previous century, those mountains yielded gold, silver, copper and cobalt. But the men were looking for a different kind of treasure: uranium. The world was emerging from World War II and careening into the Cold War. The United States needed uranium to build its nuclear weapons arsenal. Mining homegrown sources became a matter of national security. After weeks of searching, the trio hit what they thought was pay dirt. Their instruments detected intense radioactivity in brownish-red veins of ore exposed in a rocky outcrop within California’s Clark Mountain Range. But instead of uranium, the brownish-red stuff turned out to be bastnaesite, a mineral bearing fluorine, carbon and 17 curious elements known collectively as rare earths. Traces of radioactive thorium, also in the ore, had set the Geiger counters pinging. As disappointing as that must have been, the bastnaesite still held value, and the prospectors sold their claim to the Molybdenum Corporation of America, later called Molycorp. The company was interested in mining the rare earths. During the mid-20th century, rare earth elements were becoming useful in a variety of ways: Cerium, for example, was the basis for a glass-polishing powder and europium lent luminescence to recently invented color television screens and fluorescent lamps.",

The 15-0 match was in the mid-1990s. It later became an annual fixture, with the war and peace teams competing for the “Tolstoy Cup”.",

      "Israel Adesanya finally did it. “The Last Stylebender” reclaimed his UFC middleweight title in ferocious fashion with a second-round knockout at UFC 287, which took place Saturday at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Fla. Adesanya’s long-in-the-making revenge headlined a busy night that also saw Gilbert Burns send Jorge Masvidal into retirement, plus a whole lot more. Somehow, some way, for the fourth time in a row, the man with all the in-fight momentum on Saturday wound up losing in the blink of an eye. Only, at long last, it was Adesanya’s turn to twist the knife. And it couldn’t have been more perfect. With his back stuck against the fence in a scene eerily reminiscent of UFC 281’s finishing sequence, “The Last Stylebender” flipped the series’ script with a rope-a-dope that would’ve made Ali proud, sending his nemesis straight to the land of wind and ghosts just as it felt like history was repeating itself all over again and Pereira was on the verge of completing a 4-0 sweep. Plenty of top fighters would’ve crumbled under the weight of the Brazilian’s power and pressure in that moment, but Adesanya bit down on his mouthpiece and delivered a highlight for the ages. Altogether, it’s truly one of the most bat-s*** combat sports rivalries I’ve seen, Shyamalan-esque with its twist endings and unexpected turns, with few parallels really to speak of.",

      "NEWARK, New Jersey — Faced with congested airports, rising costs, a pilot shortage and a resurgence in travel demand, airlines are increasingly turning to the same remedy: bigger planes that fit more passengers. Flights operated by the 11 largest U.S. airlines had an average of more than 153 seats on domestic flights last year, up from an average of nearly 141 seats in 2017, according to aviation data firm Cirium. In April, U.S. carriers have 0.6% more seats in their domestic schedules compared with the same month of 2019, despite operating 10.6% fewer flights. The trend toward larger planes, part of a strategy known in the industry as “upgauging,” means airlines can sell more seats on each flight and make do with fewer planes, which are in short supply. While more passengers per plane drive down an airline’s unit costs, it means fewer flight options for consumers.",

TikTok said it had 'invested heavily' to stop under-13s accessing the site. The ICO said many were able to access the site despite TikTok setting 13 as the minimum age to create an account. It said that childrens data may have been used to track and profile them, and potentially present them with harmful or inappropriate content formation commissioner John Edwards said: There are laws in place to make sure our children are as safe in the digital world as they are in the physical world.

      "Time is its enemy,” Jamaica Kincaid wrote of a garden. “Time passing is merely the countdown for the parting between garden and gardener.” Writers about nature, curated or otherwise, are often counting days, recording months. Henry David Thoreau, in 1854, let his readers know that he spent two years and two months and two days at Walden Pond. The marvellous “Diary of a Young Naturalist,” by Dara McAnulty, documents nature as he saw it in his fourteenth year on earth. (He published the book, to great acclaim, at seventeen.) It’s the snowdrops, then the witch hazels, then the cherry blossoms, and so on—but we often turn to the story of nature because it’s told to us in a circle. When Aldo Leopold published “A Sand County Almanac,” in 1949—a book considered central to the modern environmental movement—he divided it up by months. He wrote something that has a progression but that also feels like a kind of extended standing still: the months move forward only to come back again. Relentless time—aging without renewal—is frequently what is (often reassuringly, beautifully) obscured in nature writing.",

At ground level, the island, one of more than 350 in the San Blas archipelago off the northern coast of Panama, is hot, flat and crowded. More than 1,000 people occupy the narrow dwellings that cover virtually every bit of the 150-by-400-meter island, which is slowly being swallowed by rising seas driven by climate change. This year, about 300 families from Gardi Sugdub are expected to begin moving to a new community on the mainland. The resettlement plan was initiated by the residents there more than a decade ago when they could no longer deny that the island couldn’t accommodate the growing population. Rising seas and intense storms are only making the predicament more dire. Many of the older adults will opt to stay put. Some still don’t believe climate change poses a threat, but 70-year-old Pedro Lopez is not among them. Lopez, whose cousin interpreted for him during our Zoom interview, currently shares a small house with 16 family members and the family dog. He doesn’t plan to move. He knows Gardi Sugdub, translated as Crab Island, along with many others in the archipelago, is going underwater, but he believes it won’t happen within his lifetime. The Indigenous Guna people have occupied these Caribbean islands since around the mid-1800s, when they abandoned the coastal jungle area near what is now the Panama-Colombia border to establish better trade and escape disease-carrying pests. Now, they are among the estimated hundreds of millions of people worldwide who by the end of the century may be forced to flee their land because of rising sea levels (SN: 5/9/20 & 5/23/20, p. 22)",

      "When a strong tornado roars through a city, it often leaves behind demolished buildings, broken tree limbs and trails of debris. But a similarly powerful storm touching down over barren, unvegetated land is much harder to spot in the rearview mirror. Now, satellite imagery has revealed a 60-kilometer-long track of moist earth in Arkansas that was invisible to human eyes. The feature was presumably excavated by a tornado when it stripped away the uppermost layer of the soil, researchers report in the March 28 Geophysical Research Letters. This method of looking for “hidden” tornado tracks is particularly valuable for better understanding storms that strike in the winter, when there’s less vegetation, the researchers suggest. And recent research has shown that wintertime storms are likely to increase in intensity as the climate warms (SN: 12/16/21). Over 1,000 tornadoes strike the United States each year, according to the National Weather Service. But not all are equally likely to be studied, says Darrel Kingfield, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved in the research. For starters, storms that pass over populated areas are more apt to be analyzed. “There’s historically been a pretty big population bias,” Kingfield says. Storms that occur over vegetated regions also tend to be well studied, simply because they leave obvious scars on the landscape. Ripped-up grasses or downed trees function like beacons to indicate the path of a storm, says Kingfield, who has studied forests damaged by tornadoes.",

This is a computer science technique that allows computers to learn from examples or experience. Take AlphaGo, for instance. This AI famously beat human champions at a complex game called Go. AlphaGo learned to play by studying 30 million Go moves that people had made. The AI then honed its skills by playing against different versions of itself. AI has the power to do a lot of good.

      "'Damning' report calls for major National Grid changes to prevent UK missing key wind power targets",

      "The UK will miss a key target to install 50 gigawatts (GW) of wind power by the end of the decade unless major changes are made to the grid, according to a government-commissioned report. The 50GW target is at the heart of the government's plans to phase out more polluting types of electricity generation by 2035, while also boosting energy security. Tim Pick, who was appointed last year as an offshore wind champion to independently advise government and industry on the development of the UK's offshore wind sector, said installing 40GW of wind power by 2030 may be achievable - but this falls short of the target. This has resulted in British consumers paying hundreds of millions of pounds to turn wind power off, and gas generators on, closer to the source of demand. The independent report warns this is one of the major limiting factors to industry progress. If you take just one message from this report, it should be the urgent need to upgrade our national grid for a world of high renewables penetration, and widespread electrification of homes and businesses, the report said. Grid connections are increasingly becoming the rate-limiting factor for our offshore wind deployment going forward.",

Or fans of the original Roman Empire. From the ancient Myceneans in the Mediterranean to the Anasazi in Arizona, societies throughout history have often gone the way of the dinosaurs and the dodo. Wars, or disease, or altered weather patterns, or natural disasters, or famine have repeatedly tipped complex regional societies past the point of stability, initiating chaos, ruin and ultimately total demise. In his original unabridged dictionary, published in 1828, Noah Webster defined civilization as “the state of being refined in manners, from the grossness of savage life, and improved in arts and learning. Today civilization is a lot more complicated. Now civilization connotes global complexity and technological sophistication beyond anything Webster would have recognized. Civilization has become a state “marked by urbanization, advanced techniques (as of agriculture and industry), expanded population, and complex social organization,” as the most recent unabridged Webster’s dictionary describes it.",

This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood's worst-kept weight loss secret.

The company announced it would expand its EV fast-charging network to Walmart and Sam’s Club locations across the country, adding to the nearly 1,300 EV stations currently in operation at 280 of the company’s locations. Walmart did not provide more detail on the investments. The big-box retailer said it’s in the process of identifying suppliers. It plans to own and operate the EV charging stations in its national network. The company expects an average of four chargers to be installed at each participating store, Reuters reported. In the past, Walmart has worked with EV charger providers EVgo and Electrify America. The company has grown its network substantially over the last two years. “Easy access to on-the-go charging is a game-changer for drivers who have been hesitant to purchase an EV for concerns they won’t be able to find a charger in a clean, bright and safe location when needed,” Vishal Kapadia, senior vice president of energy transformation, said in a statement.",

      "Nineties fashion was hard to pin down. A clash of trends screamed for our attention while others were so quietly cool they're still sartorial staples in our collective wardrobes: slip dresses, Doc Martens, chokers, crop tops. While the 1980s were all about volume -- padded shoulders, puffed jackets, big hair and an obsession with designer wear -- style in the early 1990s was decidedly low maintenance. The slip dress, one of the decade's most enduring garments, is perhaps the most glaring example of this. Spaghetti straps held up barely-there silk dresses, swapping the frills of the '80s for minimalist ease. Weekends were about biker shorts, turtlenecks, high-waisted jeans and baggy, logo tees. Hair was scraped into scrunchies or left as flouncy, unstyled manes.",

After losing a unanimous decision in the co-main event, Masvidal announced his retirement from the sport while telling Burns “go get that belt” as they embraced following a three-round battle. “I love everybody here,” Masvidal shouted to the Miami faithful. “This is where I started my career, it’s been a long 20 years, 50 some fights. Sometimes your favorite basketball player don’t have that 3-pointer no more. Your favorite quarterback loses that rifle. I don’t feel the same when I get in here no more. It’s been 20 long years. While Masvidal was saying goodbye, Burns was celebrating a victory with the judges scoring the fight 30-27, 30-27 and 29-28 in his favor. Afterwards, Burns paid homage to his opponent and then quickly turned his attention to the welterweight title. There was a lot of respect being shown early with Burns and Masvidal both waiting for the other to make a mistake to really unleash. Masvidal did start to establish a well-timed leg kick that was chopping away at Burns’ foundation.",

Dierk Raabe, and colleagues reviewed the use of artificial intelligence in materials science and the untapped spaces it opens if combined with physics-based simulations. Compared to traditional simulation methods, AI has several advantages and will play a crucial role in material sciences in the future. Advanced materials are urgently needed for everyday life, be it in high technology, mobility, infrastructure, green energy or medicine. However, traditional ways of discovering and exploring new materials encounter limits due to the complexity of chemical compositions, structures and targeted properties. Moreover, new materials should not only enable novel applications, but also include sustainable ways of producing, using and recycling them. Researchers from the Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung (MPIE) review the status of physics-based modelling and discuss how combining these approaches with artificial intelligence can open so far untapped spaces for the design of complex materials. They published their perspective in the journal Nature Computational Science.",

Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that only 27.5% of private-sector businesses reported that their employees worked from home or another remote location some or all of the time between August 1, 2022 and September 30, 2022. In other words, 72.5% of private-sector organizations — up from 60% in the July-to-September 2021 period — said they did not have employees working remotely.

      "This is another in our series of stories identifying new technologies and actions that can slow climate change, reduce its impacts or help communities cope with a rapidly changing world. An American eel slipped through a pipe, careening toward a spinning turbine blade. A moment later, the eel emerged on the other side. “It was clear that the eel looked fine,” Gia Schneider recalls. She was part of a research team that cheered its success. Then they got another eel ready to go. As its CEO, Schneider runs Natel Energy in Alameda, Calif. This company works on hydropower. A type of clean energy, it uses spinning turbines to turn the motion of water into electricity. So why was this team sending eels on a water-park-like thrill ride? Most turbines have sharp, blade-like edges. These kill many of the eels and other fish unlucky enough to encounter them. Schneider realized that a different type of blade might let fish through unharmed while still spinning fast enough to make electricity. So her team has unveiled one. They gave it a thick edge and a twisty shape. Now scientists from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., were testing it. During the experiment, 131 eels went through the turbine. All survived. To slow climate change, people must switch from fossil fuels to greener, cleaner sources of power. These are sources that won’t spew greenhouse gases into the air. Hydropower is one option. Solar and wind are two others. “Energy consumption underpins everything about our civilization,” says Schneider. Changing how we make energy won’t be easy. But many experts believe this shift not only is possible but also necessary.",
